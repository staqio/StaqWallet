# Staq Wallet

### Requirements

- Xcode 16
- Apple Swift version 6.0

### Installation

#### Using Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add the package dependency to your Package.swift file and add the dependency to the dependencies array. Here's an example:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/staqio/StaqWallet", from: "1.2.0")
]
```

```swift
targets: [
    .target(name: "TargetName", dependencies:[
        "StaqWallet"
    ])
]
```

Run the command `swift package update` to download the package and its dependencies.

### Usage

To start the wallet flow, import the StaqWallet framework and utilize the `StaqWallet` class it provides. This class enables users to initiate the wallet process after setting up the necessary configuration.

#### StaqWalletConfig

A struct representing the configuration parameters required to initialize and authenticate the StaqWallet SDK.

**Parameters**

- userId: A unique identifier for the user.
- secret: A secret key used for authentication.
- email: (Optional) The userâ€™s email address.
- language: The preferred language for the wallet interface. Defaults to .en.
- walletEnv: The environment in which the wallet operates (e.g., production, sandbox). Defaults to .production.

**Example Usage**

```swift
import StaqWallet

StaqWallet.start(
    withConfig: StaqWalletConfig(...),
    fromNavigationController: navigationController
)
```

#### Navigation Controller Setup

You must provide a `UINavigationController` to the SDK for navigation purposes. This navigation controller will be used internally by the SDK to push and present views.

Ensure that a valid UINavigationController instance is passed to the SDK, as it is required for proper navigation handling.

#### Face ID Setup

Make sure to enable Face ID in your app by adding the following key to your Info.plist file:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID to authenticate your identity quickly and securely.</string>
```

If this key is not added, your application will crash when attempting to use Face ID.

#### Document Scanning & KYC Verification

For features like document scanning and KYC verification, you need to add camera and microphone permissions to your Info.plist:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to capture your documents for verification purposes.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone to assist in the verification process.</string>
```

Again, if these permissions are missing, the app will crash when the camera or microphone is required.

#### Domestic User Authentication Redirection

Domestic users can register a wallet using Nafath services. To enable redirection to the Nafath application, you need to add the following query scheme to your Info.plist:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>nafath</string>
</array>
```

This ensures that your app can check if the Nafath app is installed and seamlessly redirect users to complete the registration process.

#### Handling Navigation for Ordered Packages

The domestic wallet does not provide built-in navigation functionality for displaying ordered packages. Therefore, you must handle navigation manually by supplying a navigation callback to the `setPackagesNavigationCallback` method on the StaqWallet instance.

```swift
StaqWallet.setPackagesNavigationCallback {
    // Implement your custom navigation logic here
}
```

### Example Code to Start the Wallet Flow

Below is a minimal implementation in your SceneDelegate to initialize the Wallet flow:

```swift
import StaqWallet
import UIKit

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(
        _ scene: UIScene,
        willConnectTo session: UISceneSession,
        options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions
    ) {
        guard let windowScene = scene as? UIWindowScene else { return }
        let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
        self.window = window

        let rootViewController = UIViewController()
        let navigationController = UINavigationController(
            rootViewController: rootViewController
        )

        window.rootViewController = navigationController
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()

        let config = StaqWalletConfig(
            userId: "user-id",
            secret: "user-secret",
            email: "user-email",
            language: .en,
        )

        StaqWallet.setPackagesNavigationCallback {
            // Implement your custom navigation logic here
        }

        StaqWallet.start(
            withConfig: config,
            fromNavigationController: navigationController
        )
    }
}
```

- Breakdown View (`breakdown`): A detailed view showing payment order parameters.

**Parameters**

- `variant`: Specifies the layout type (`inline` or `breakdown`).
- `state`: The state object that manages the Wallet Pay view's behavior and balance (`WalletPayViewState`).
- `params`: The parameters for the payment order (`StaqWalletPay.PaymentOrderParams`).

**Example Usage**

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var state = WalletPayViewState(
        isSelected: false,
        balance: 100.0
    )

    var body: some View {
        WalletPayView(
            variant: .breakdown,
            state: state,
            params: StaqWalletPay.PaymentOrderParams(...)
        )
        .onTapGesture {
            state.isSelected.toggle()
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var walletPayView: UIWalletPayView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        walletPayView = UIWalletPayView(
            frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 150),
            variant: .inline,
            state: WalletPayViewState(isSelected: false, balance: 100.0),
            params: StaqWalletPay.PaymentOrderParams(...)
        )

        let tapGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(
            target: self,
            action: #selector(handleTap)
        )
        walletPayView.addGestureRecognizer(tapGesture)

        view.addSubview(walletPayView)
        walletPayView.center = view.center
    }

    @objc private func handleTap() {
        walletPayView.isSelected.toggle()
    }
